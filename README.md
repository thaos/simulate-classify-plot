Lorenz63 for 100 trajectories

Step 1: Simulate the coordinates of x, y, z (in phase space) for 100 trajectories (Euler or RK4 scheme).,\n
Step 2: Classify regions by calculating distance using coding theory leading to time series.,\n
Step 3: 2D and 3D plot the classified regions.,\n
Step 4: Boxplots of probability within given timesteps using Committor function
